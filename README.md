# webots_crazyflie
An extended repository for autonomous control of crazyflies in webots

In its current status, a grid world representation is used for the base environment.

You can specify input positions after being prompted and the drone will navigate to the position if possible

## Installation
The code should work out of the box with Webots R2023a
Not tested for earlier webots version

## Usage
No dependencies are needed
Just download and Install Webots, clone this repo, start running


## Limitations
Currently, there is no autonomous obstacle avoidance - if an obstacle is detected drone will stop and block

There is a TODO to fix this at a later time.
